# CH-ShellScriptPract
 Practice scripts written to learn Unix/Linux Shell scripting.

This repository contains practice Linux/Unix scripts written by me (Chris Haller) while working from the book "Classic Shell Scripting"
Arnold Robbins and Nelson H. F. Beebe. The repository serves primarily to document my experience, while also providing 
some examples that I can come back to should I need to do so in the future.
